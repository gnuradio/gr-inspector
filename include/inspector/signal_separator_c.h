     * \details
     * Signal Separator block takes input signal and RF map with signal center
     * frequencies and bandwidths and filters the input spectrum for each signal.
     *
     * Internally, FIR filters get calculated according to the RF map's specs.
     * The steepness of the filters can be set with the relative transition width parameter.
     * The spectrum gets shifted by the center frequency of each signal and filtered
     * with the corresponding filter calculated from the RF map information. A floored integer
     * decimation will be applied according to the set oversampling factor
     * (decim = floor(samp_rate/(bw*OSF))).
     *
     * To save CPU load, generic taps can be precalculated with the tool in the apps/
     * folder. This tool outputs a JSON file, which path can be specified in the block
     * parameter <code>file_path</code>.
     *
     * Output of this block is a pmt vector of tuples in the format
     *
     * <code>#[#(SigNo, cfreq, bandwidth, #[vector of samples]), #(...)]</code>
