     * \brief Signal detection block using energy detection.
     * \ingroup inspector
     *
     * \details
     * Takes input spectrum as complex float and performs an energy detection
     * to find potential continuous signals and build a RF map (tuple
     * of center frequency and bandwidth). The RF map gets passed as a
     * message with center frequency and bandwidth information for each detected
     * signal.
     *
     * Threshold for energy detection can either be set in dB or an automatic
     * threshold calculation can be performed by setting a sensitivity between 0
     * and 1. The PSD is then sorted and searched for relative power jumps with height
     * (1-sensitivity) and the threshold is set to the sample before that jump
     * (which should be the strongest noise sample).
     *
     * To surpress false detection in noisy scenarios, the minimum signal bandwidth
     * can be set. All detected signals smaller than this value will not be written
     * in the RF map.
     *
     * To average the PSD (and provide a better detection) an single pole IIR
     * filter is implemented in this block. The parameter alpha can be set as
     * block parameter. The IIR equation yields y[n] = alpha*x[n]+(1-alpha)*y[n-1].
     *
     * The bandwidth of the detected signals can be quantized relative to the
     * sampling rate. This leads to less recalculations in the Signal Separator
     * block. There, a filter must be recalculated, when the bandwidth of a signal
     * changed.
