     * This block can be inserted downstream to the OFDM parameter
     * estimation block. It performs a frequency offset estimation and
     * symbol timing estimation according to [1]. Frequency offsets smaller than the
     * subcarrier spacing will be corrected to obtain orthogonality of
     * the carriers. Output is a stream with stream tags at the estimated
     * OFDM symbol beginnings (PMT symbol "symbol").
     *
     * Connect output of OFDM parameter estimator to message port and
     * signal itself to the stream input.
