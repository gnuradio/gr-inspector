     * Signal Extractor block is able to extract signal samples for specified
     * signal out of message passed by Signal Separator block. These messages
     * contain the samples of all detected signals. This block only passes the
     * ones beloging to the specified signal number as a complex stream. This
     * way, custom signal chains can be appended after the inspector blocks.
     *
     * If the resample option is used, the block will try to resample the
     * input samples based on the message input from the map port to the
     * desired output sample rate. An oversampling factor can be taken
     * into account, if the input samples are oversampled by the
     * signal separator.
