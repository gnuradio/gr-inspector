/*!
 * \brief GUI for the inspector toolkit
 * \ingroup inspector
 *
 * \details
 * This GUI uses QT and QWT to create a graphical interface to control the
 * inspector and get feedback about the detected and analyzed signals.
 *
 * The PSD estimation of the Signal Detector block gets displayed here along
 * with signal markers and informations. Manual signal selection can be done
 * within the GUI created by this block.
 *
 * Analysis blocks can pass information to the GUI block by providing
 * messages in the tuple format
 *
 * <code>((pmt::intern("signal"), pmt::from_uint64(signal_no)),
 * (pmt::intern("description1"), pmt::from_float(value1)), ...)</code>
 *
 * Controls: Use CTRL+LeftMouse to zoom, RightMouse to zoom out.
 * This prevents confusion when in manual selection mode, where the
 * signals are selected with LeftMouse.
 *
 * Message ports:
 * - map in: takes RF map from Signal Detector block and visualizes the included
 * information in the plot
 * - analysis_in: takes messages of analysis blocks and displays their content
 * in the GUI plot.
 * - map out: passes either the input message when manual selection is deactivated
 * or passes RF map according to the user's manual settings.
