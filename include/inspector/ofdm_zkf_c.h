     * This block performs a parameter estimation of an input OFDM signal.
     * Parameters that get estimated are FFT length, cyclic prefix length,
     * symbol time and subcarrier spacing. For the estimation, the algorithm
     * in [1] is used. Input is a complex stream, output is a message as
     * tupel of tupels containing analysis results description and values.
