description: |-
  This toolbox provides algorithms, blocks and tools for signal analysis and
  spectrum monitoring. Detailed functionality includes signal detection and
  signal filtering/mixing/decimating/resampling. Further, it is possible
  to estimate OFDM signal parameters and synchronize to a given OFDM signal.

  This project was initiated as a Google Summer of Code project and developed in
  cooperation with the *Communication Engineering Lab (CEL)* at the *Karlsruhe
  Institute of Technology (KIT)*, Germany, <http://www.cel.kit.edu>.
