This GNU Radio module is part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program 2016. The target is to develop a signal analysis / signal intelligence toolbox with the following capabilities:

- Automatic signal detection
- Automatic modulation classification
- GUI feedback
- Doxygen documentation

Additional functionality for the post-GSoC period can be:

- Signal allocation database
- Automatic demodulation
- Automatic decoding
